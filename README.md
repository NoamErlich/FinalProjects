# FinalProjects

# Hello, this file showcases my past projects (the largest one being Billiard).
# This file also includes another project that was a learning experience for UWP Workspace and XAML.
# The game itself is almost finished, with the only thing missing being the database and related functionality; otherwise, it works.
# I have many more projects that, unfortunately, I cannot upload to GitHub,
# such as one I made in Assembly or a couple of Console-Apps games in C# and Python.
# I will be uploading the project documentation for the major projects (even if I couldn't upload some of the projects),
# such as Billiard, Snake, and Tic-tac-toe (in Assembly).
